# Learning Repository.

Welcome to my learning repository! This repository contains all my code, notes, and challenges from my journey to becoming a senior full-stack software developer. I am currently focusing on mastering the fundamentals of programming with the following technologies:

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript
4. TypeScript
5. Python
6. MySQL

# Structure of This Repository.

Each technology has its own folder, where I store my daily and weekly challenges, project files, and notes. The repository follows a structured format:

## Tracking Progress.

I will update my progress regularly, documenting my challenges and solutions. Periodically, I will revisit my progress and refine my learning plan.

## Graduation from Fundamentals.

I expect to complete the fundamentals within two months and then move on to:

1. Building real-world projects.
2. Learning advanced frameworks like Next.js, Express.js, and Django.
3. Diving deeper into data structures and algorithms.
4. Exploring backend development and API design.
